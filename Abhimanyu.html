Now cut to the 13th day of Kurukshetra battle. Dronacharya out a plan into action on the battlefield such that Arjuna and his charioteer Lord Krishna were diverted to another faraway part of the battlefield, chasing the Samasaptakas. On the other hand, the Chakravyuh formation turned so lethal that it threatened to swallow the entire Pandava army. Something had to be done quickly. The Pandavas decided to back Abhimanyu into the Chakravyuh and take on the Kuru might.</div>
Now Abhimanyu knew from his mother's womb as to how to breach various types of Chakravyuhs such as Makaravyoha, Kurmavyooha, Sarpavyuha etc and accordingly he began breaking into the formation in an impressive manner. Jayadratha, an evil debauched king from Sindh then effectively blocked the path behind Abhimanyu so as to keep the Pandavas out.
